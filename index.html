		I’m a big fan of Snapchat and I’m a big fan of quality branding, but I’m not a big fan of invasive advertising. For someone like me, Snapchat has the opportunity to provide brands with an effective outlet: the Snapchat Story.

		The ad world has shifted attention to Native Advertising - producing content that enhances a person’s experience with a brand.  In a recent <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2013/10/native-advertising-how-it-works-at-the-huffington-post/">article</a>, PBS’s Paige Cooperstein explained it as, “...Any advertising that integrates fully into the content within which it is placed.” This article implies native advertising integrates into media outlets in forms of other articles, but the key in Cooperstein’s quote is “into the content within which it is placed.”
	</p>

	<p>
		If native ads are on the New York Times’ website then the ad might look like an article; If it’s placed on Facebook it will look like a wall post; if it’s placed on Twitter it will look like a tweet. Regardless, it won’t look like an ad, it will look like useful content in which someone might be interested. So if the medium is Snapchat it will look like a snap, right?
	<p/>

	<p>
		In the original format for Snapchat, this type of advertising would be time consuming and possibly annoying. Users would have to follow a brand and the brand would have to follow each user back in order to send out a snap. Then, to send one snap to all of its followers, the brand (or intern) would have to individually select each follower. I can testify for how annoying it is to send the <i>quality</i> snaps I perceive worthy for all my friends’ viewing. If a brand starts snappin too much, they might lose an audience; if the snaps are uninteresting the brand is just advertising and clogging my contacts list.

		Snapchat’s October 3<sup>rd</sup> <a href="http://blog.snapchat.com/post/62975810329/surprise">update</a> introduced a potential game-changer: Snapchat Stories. Users can record a snap (picture/video) and add it to their Story instead of sending it to specific users. Their followers can then play this story for up to 24 hours. The story first shows up on the same screen as new snaps, but after being viewed it is removed from this page and the Story can then be found under the send user’s name in the contact list for the 24 hour period.

	<p>
		For a long time I thought Stories was stupid. I always loved the simplicity of Snapchat. I thought the Stories feature was too much and plus my friends make the dumbest Stories. I still think the feature is pretty gimmicky, but I think I found a good use for it...

		<strong>Brands and Useful Content</strong>
	</p>

	<p>
		While Stories does not cut out the process where people have to follow a brand and the brand follows them back, it does cut out the process of selecting each person when sending the snap. So now brands can post content onto their Story, and users can access it at will for the 24 hour duration. But before we get too excited, there are a couple of questions that might lead to a couple of answers.
	</p>	

	<p>
		Who’s going to follow what brand? All companies would love their website was as common of a home page as Google, but that’s not reality. So the quandary of gaining followers is identical to that of Facebook pages, Twitter handles and Instagram accounts: People will follow a brand if they want to, not because they have to. Stories is not a banner ad. Word of mouth and personal push is often the most effective way to drive followers onto the aforementioned mediums, but I don’t think there is a solid answer of how to get people to follow you … or at least I don’t have one.
	</p>	

	<p>
		What should a Story look like? Take a look at Wired’s Twitter feed: Wired posts articles from its website so its followers can stay up to date on their publication – that’s advertising and that’s branding. They have a plethora of articles published daily, but the tweeted ones might only be relevant to current events/trends. Wired tweets important content for their followers and their followers like that &lt;&lt; good branding. Contrast that with Major Lazer’s <a href="https://twitter.com/MAJORLAZER">Twitter</a> feed. Though the maturity level might differ from Wired’s, Major Lazer holds fast to their image and their followers like that &lt;&lt; good branding. Check out Red Bull’s <a href="http://instagram.com/redbull">Instagram</a> or like the Boiler Room’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/boilerroom.tv?ref=br_tf">Facebook</a> page – it’s all the same: content that followers want to see. Snapchat should be no different. A brand exists because of its perceived image.

	<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">PUMPKIN SPICE BUBBLE BUTT

	— MAJOR PIGGY (@MAJORLAZER) <a href="https://twitter.com/MAJORLAZER/statuses/390750622804639744">October 17, 2013</a></blockquote>

	<p>
		However, the use is different on Stories, so the content should adjust accordingly. Snapchat gives the opportunity of exclusivity because it speaks directly to an individual user even though the content could be shared on a mass scale. The interface of Snapchat makes users (or at least me) feel like <em>they</em> have been sent something regardless if they can guess that a friend sent a mass snap (especially if it’s past 11:00pm on a Saturday). Rather than the centralized platform that Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook use (accessing the interface and pulling from a feed), Snapchat is perceived similar to text messaging: I send something to you, then you receive it;  if I didn't send it to you, then you won't see it.

		The idea I have been throwing around is for a music project I'm working on with my close friend, <a href="http://www.neil-kirkpatrick.com/">Neil Kirkpatrick</a>. (A quick synopsis: Produce a single show and use our learned skills at the <a href="http://lefalc.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/puddles.jpg?w=468">UO</a> to experiment with new ways of advertising a music performance. I will follow up with a post explaining more details about this project). Part of our project is filming a mini-series about our band/project as scripted characters with the idea of creating hype about our performance. We are going use the Stories feature to create short glimpses into our characters' lives between and after the releases of our mini-series to continue the awareness (and the humor).  People in our campus/Eugene area - who we find as our audience and who are our friends on Snapchat - will be able to see our up-to videos and hopefully have a laugh. Our intent is to keep our friends and new followers aware of the show. We'll see how this pans out.

		The 24 hour feature of Stories adds an element of suspense and excitement. Who knows, it might lead to a screenshot posted of Facebook or Twitter. The real question is: Will this catch on? My only advice for brands that attempt it:

	<p>
	Do Not Suck. Do Not Advertise.
