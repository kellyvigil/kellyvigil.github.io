		I'm a big fan of Snapchat and I'm a big fan of quality branding, but I'm not a big fan of invasive advertising. For someone like me, Snapchat has the opportunity to provide brands with an effective outlet: the Snapchat Story.

		The ad world has shifted attention to Native Advertising - producing content that enhances a person's experience with a brand. In a recent <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2013/10/native-advertising-how-it-works-at-the-huffington-post/">article</a>, PBS's Paige Cooperstein explained it as, "...Any advertising that integrates fully into the content within which it is placed." This article implies native advertising integrates into media outlets in forms of other articles, but the key in Cooperstein's quote is "into the content within which it is placed."
	</p>

	<p>
		If native ads are on the New York Times' website then the ad might look like an article; If it's placed on Facebook it will look like a wall post; if it's placed on Twitter it will look like a tweet. Regardless, it won't look like an ad, it will look like useful content in which someone might be interested. So if the medium is Snapchat it will look like a snap, right?
	<p/>

	<p>
		In the original format for Snapchat, this type of advertising would be time consuming and possibly annoying. Users would have to follow a brand and the brand would have to follow each user back in order to send out a snap. Then, to send one snap to all of its followers, the brand (or intern) would have to individually select each follower. I can testify for how annoying it is to send the <i>quality</i> snaps I perceive worthy for all my friends' viewing. If a brand starts snappin too much, they might lose an audience; if the snaps are uninteresting the brand is just advertising and clogging my contacts list.
